Implementation of the Linear Optics from Closed Orbit (LOCO) algorithm for optimizing FCC-ee lattice parameters using Python's Accelerator Toolbox (PyAT). 

Key Highlights:
Two examples are avavilable including:
-Alignment Error Analysis: Exploring the impact of alignment errors on FCC-ee z-mode lattice optics parameters.
-Correction Chain Utilization: Utilize a correction chain to iteratively reach the desired optics parameters.
-Verification with PETRAIII Measurements: Validate the LOCO implementation by performing a verification on measurements from PETRAIII.
